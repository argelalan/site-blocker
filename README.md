# Site-Blocker
Finding yourself getting distracted by those pesky social media notifications? This Python script can block access to any website for a given time period.

## How it Works:
### Host file and localhost
All operating systems have a **host** file which connects your computer's hostname to IP addresses. It contains a *localhost* address which allows for connections to be established with your computer. If a website's url were to be redirected to your localhost address, connection to any real site would be prevented. This is precisely how the script will block access to websites.
